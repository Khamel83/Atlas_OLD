# Atlas Project Roadmap
*The Single Source of Truth for Atlas Development*

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Document Status**: Authoritative - All project planning references this document  
**Project Phase**: Critical Implementation Phase

## Executive Summary

Atlas is a sophisticated local-first content ingestion and cognitive amplification platform that is **95% architecturally complete** but requires critical implementation work to bridge documentation and actual functionality. The system has excellent foundational architecture but needs focused development to deliver on its cognitive amplification promises.

**Current Status**: 4 critical implementation gaps block core cognitive features  
**Estimated Resolution**: 57-89 hours of focused development (6-9 weeks)  
**Next Milestone**: Fully functional cognitive amplification platform

## Project Vision and Goals

### Core Mission
Transform how users interact with and derive insights from their personal knowledge base through:
- **Local-first processing** that preserves privacy and data ownership
- **Cognitive amplification** that helps users think better, not just store more
- **Intelligent content curation** that surfaces relevant information proactively
- **Seamless multi-format ingestion** from web, audio, video, and document sources

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Privacy-First Architecture**: All processing happens locally, no cloud dependency for core features
2. **Cognitive Enhancement**: Provide tools that amplify human thinking and insight generation
3. **Seamless Integration**: Work with existing workflows and content sources
4. **Extensible Platform**: Support plugins and custom integrations
5. **User Empowerment**: Users maintain full control over their data and AI interactions

## Conclusion

Atlas represents a sophisticated and well-architected platform for local-first cognitive amplification. The current critical implementation gaps are primarily integration issues rather than fundamental architecture problems. With focused development effort over the next 11 weeks, Atlas can become a fully functional, production-ready cognitive amplification platform that delivers on its ambitious vision.

The immediate priority is completing Phase 1 to restore core functionality and provide a solid foundation for advanced feature development. This roadmap provides a clear path from the current state to a comprehensive cognitive amplification platform that empowers users to think better and derive more insights from their personal knowledge base.
